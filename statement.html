<h2>Artist Statement</h2>

<p>
All children are given crayons and a scratchpad and are encouraged to draw, as did I. But when I was nine years old and in the third grade something happened which completely changed my life. The tall figure of my teacher, Miss Porry, was folded into her desk chair as she began to correct the first papers handed in to her, her curly gray hair framing her face as she bent intently over the papers. I had already handed her and was sitting idly at my desk waiting for the recess bell. The classroom was silent and intense. The sun was shining on the greenish-purple leaves of the tall eucalyptus trees trembling in the breeze outside the windows. Inside, Mary at the desk in front of mine, was still struggling to fill in the questions, the back of her head half dark as she bent forward. Johnny, at the desk next to mine, was wearing a thick, red woolen jacket, too hot for this warm, spring day. He stared at his paper. All of a sudden I didn’t recognize anyone or anything and thought I had awakened in an unknown place. These shapes around me—what were they? I’d never seen them before. A rush of excitement filled me, and then fear. What was happening? Where am I? It was the wondrous discovery of a new world. It was as though I had never been aware of my existence before. It was a beautiful thrill and I was able to repeat the feeling years afterwards by just thinking about it.

From that point on I began to focus on art. I’d use crayons and later in sixth grade my teacher would excuse me on Thursday afternoons to go to private lessons with an artist. In high school I studied art and majored in art when I entered Pomona College in 1951, graduating Magma Cum Laude, receiving a Phi Beta Kappa key and receiving a scholarship to the Art Institute of Chicago. The Institute had always been an outstanding art school, but at the time it had many students who had fled Germany and brought cubism, non-objectivism—the Chicago Art Institute benefited greatly from their input. Later, when I was teaching at Humboldt State University, I used the aesthetic principles I’d learned in Chicago. I taught at HSU from 1956 to 1981.

I use five elements in my paintings, each of which is critical to my art. One is COLOR, complementary or opposite, which emphasizes each other. There are three sets, red and green, orange and blue, and yellow and purple. When I want to focus on an image or theme I paint those forms in complements. The second element I use is SPACE. In realist painting, forms get smaller as they recede into the distance. I prefer to use isometric space where all forms are equal as though right in front of the canvas. I feel it gives more power to the images. The third element is LINE. I draw all images on the panel before I color them in. I like the dramatic color contrast of the two lines. Of course I also make many line drawings in preparation for a painting. The fourth element is MOTION/DIRECTION. This is one method of building a strong composition of the painting since the dominant images are tending to flow together in rhythm. The final element is IMAGE and of course this is the final reason for painting the picture. I am an avid reader and I enjoy classical literature, but I also use the Bible in my imagery as well as inventing my own images.
